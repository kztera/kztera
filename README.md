## Hi everyone (^^ゞ

My name is Nguyen Khoa (he/him), and I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. If nothing changes, I hope to be able to graduate as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, the keyboards in the 7th floor Computer room make me feel sick <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kztera/kztera/main/teri-smack.gif" width=50px>. I hope the school will replace them soon. I can't wait to get rid of these terrible keyboards.

## Hi everyone (^^ゞ

My name is Nguyen Khoa (he/him), and I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. If nothing changes, I hope to be able to graduate as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, the keyboards in the 7th floor Computer room make me feel sick <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kztera/kztera/main/teri-smack.gif" width=50px>. I hope the school will replace them soon. I can't wait to get rid of these terrible keyboards.

-  🎶 I love listening to music so much. I can do it all day. My favorite Banđs are Vasire, boy pablo, Wallows, Men I Trust, Dayglow, Fiji Blue, Far Caspian, PUBLIC and many more. It's hard to imagine one day I'll hear them sing live in real life xD. You can listen some of recent played songs below.
